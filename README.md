#INDICATOR 1: GCSE ATTAINMENT OF DISADVANTAGED YOUNG PEOPLE (5 OR MORE GCSES INCLUDING ENGLISH AND MATHS)

Figure 1 shows the gap for Disadvantaged pupils in the attainment of 5+ GCSE’s with grades A*-C including English and maths.  This matters because attainment at school is a key predictor of future disadvantages (see Indicator 5).  A widening gap would indicate that Disadvantaged pupils are falling behind their peers in educational attainment. 

In 2015, 27.3% of pupils at the end of key stage 4 were disadvantaged.

The gap in 2014/15 has increased by 0.5 percentage points since 2013/14. This is because even though the proportion of disadvantaged pupils achieving 5+ A*-C including English and maths has increased slightly (by 0.2 percentage points to 36.7%), the proportion of all other pupils achieving this measure increased by 0.8 percentage points to 64.7%.

#INDICATOR 2: GCSE ATTAINMENT BY AGE 19 FOR THOSE WHO DID NOT DO SO AT AGE 16 (5 OR MORE GCSES INCLUDING ENGLISH AND MATHS) 

Figure 2 shows the proportion of those pupils who did not achieve GCSE A*-C including English and maths when they were aged 16 but go on to do so by age 19.  This indicator builds on Indicator 1, by showing the extent to which disadvantaged pupils that fail to attain GCSEs in secondary education subsequently do so.

This shows that in 2015 just over 14% of those that were not eligible for free school meals eventually got their GCSEs by aged 19, compared to just 7.2% of those who were eligible for free school meals – a gap of 6.9 percentage points. This gap is significantly higher compared to gap in 2014 and previous years.

Overall, by age 19, 48.5% of young people who were in receipt of FSM at age 15 have attained Level 2 English and maths, compared to 73.6% of the non-FSM group. The FSM attainment gap of 25.1 percentage points is 0.8 percentage points narrower than it was in 2014 and is at the lowest level since comparable data began in 2005 when it was 4.7 percentage points wider.

The data are based on DfE/BIS linked datasets showing whether pupils at aged 16 gained a qualification by age 19 in either school, college apprenticeship etc. They do not indicate whether the pupils spent any time NEET – just whether or not they had progressed to Level 2 (or 3) by 19. 

#INDICATOR 3: PERCENTAGE OF YOUNG PEOPLE GAINING A LEVEL 3 QUALIFICATION BY AGE 19

This indicator measures the attainment of Level 3 qualifications for Disadvantaged pupils (again defined as having previously received Free School Meals) and other pupils.  Level 3 is equivalent to two good A-Levels, and achievement of these higher qualifications is strongly correlated with future earnings and employment (see Indicator 5).  So a wide gap indicates continuing disadvantage.

Figure 3 (for 2015) shows that 36.4% of the Disadvantaged group had achieved Level 3 by age 19, compared to 60.9% of other young people. Both of these were higher than in 2014 (+0.4 percentage points and +0.7 percentage points respectively) with the gap between Disadvantaged pupils and other pupils decreasing by 0.3 percentage points to 24.6 percentage points. The gap at Level 3 has stayed between 24 and 25 percentage points since 2011, with some year-on-year fluctuation within this. Nearly two thirds (62.7%) of non-FSM pupils that achieved Level 3 by 19 did so through A Levels/International Baccalaureate compared to 43.9% of the FSM group.

The data are based on DfE/BIS linked datasets showing whether pupils at aged 16 gained a qualification by age 19 in either school, college apprenticeship etc. They do not indicate whether the pupils spent any time NEET – just whether or not they had progressed to Level 2 (or 3) by 19.
 
 
#INDICATOR 4: PERCENTAGE OF YOUNG PEOPLE SPENDING UP TO SIX MONTHS NOT IN EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT OR TRAINING (NEET)

This indicator is intended to go a little deeper than the headline figure of NEET numbers. Some young people may be more likely to be long-term NEET than others, and conversely some may be likely to be only short-term NEET. This poses issues for the metrics that are used to identify success. We need to be alert to issues of ‘creaming’ – assisting those most likely to move off NEET and ‘parking’ – providing lesser assistance to those least likely to move off NEET.

Figure 4 shows that 11% of the youth population spend under six months NEET, while 10% spend 12 months or more NEET. There are a small group identified as ‘others’. These are young people who are NEET some of the time, but not for long consecutive periods. 

#Figure 4: Proportion of young people by NEET duration
 
 	Estimate	Low CI	High CI
Not at all NEET	5,187,000	5,035,000	5,339,000
Short term NEET	811,000	724,000	899,000
NEET 6 -12 months	484,000	432,079	536,518
NEET 12 months or more	714,000	620,000	808,000
NEET others (churners)	90,000	78,151	101,849
Source: LFS, ONS

The calculation identifies those who were short term NEET at any time in the period they were interviewed for the Labour Force Survey.
Figure 5 breaks this down by qualification, showing the proportion of all young people with that qualification level who were not at all NEET (in the 15 months covered by LFS interviews), those who were under six months NEET and those who were over six months NEET.

Even for those with no qualifications, 57% did not spend any time NEET. A similar, slightly, but not significantly, higher proportion, 58% of young people with qualifications below Level 2, were not observed as NEET.

##Figure 5: Proportion of young people by NEET duration and qualification level

Figure 6 breaks out the NEET proportions and shows the gaps between higher and lower qualification groups more clearly.

Figure 6: Proportion of young people by NEET duration and qualification level condensed
 
	Not at all NEET	Short term NEET	NEET 6 months or more
NQF Level 4 and above	924,000	171,000	118,000
NQF Level 3	1,537,000	226,000	242,000
NQF Level 2	1,581,000	232,000	358,000
Below NQF Level 2	554,000	111,000	289,000
No Qualifications	351,000	50,000	213,000
Source: LFS, ONS

This shows that the proportions of young people in each qualification group who are short-term NEET do differ, with the higher qualified having higher proportions NEET. The big gaps, however, are in those longer term NEET.

While all long-term NEET started as short-term NEET, it is clear that the risks of becoming long-term NEET are much higher for those qualified below NQF Level 2 than for the higher qualified.

#INDICATOR 5: THE PROPORTION OF YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE LONG-TERM NEET

This Indicator measures the proportion of young people that have been outside education, employment or training for at least six months.  There is strong evidence that spending a long time unemployed or inactive, particularly at a young age, can lead to long-term negative impacts on earnings, employment, health or wellbeing (so-called ‘scarring’).  

##NEET SIX MONTHS OR MORE

Our measure is again based on the Labour Force Survey.  We have defined as being NEET for six months or more those young people who are classed as being NEET in any two consecutive quarters out of the five quarters for which they are observed in the 5-quarter survey.

We estimate that, in the 8 consistent datasets used (finishing in the 4th quarter of 2015), there were 1.29 million young people NEET for six months or more. The confidence interval is between 1.17 million and 1.41 million.
The risk of being NEET for six months or more varies strongly with qualification. The risk (that is, the percentage of young people with that qualification who were NEET for six months or more) varies from 10% for those with Level 4 and over qualifications, up to 35% for those with no qualifications. Figure 7 shows this.

##Figure 7: Proportion of young people by qualification who are at risk of NEET for six months or more
 
Source: LFS, ONS

Figure 7 shows that those with Level 2 or above qualifications have a markedly lower chance of being NEET for six months or more than those with qualifications above this level. The smaller number of people with other qualifications (frequently overseas qualifications) look to have a high risk of NEET.

However, because the proportions of young people getting good qualifications has increased, the picture when you look at the balance of young people who are NEET six months by qualification looks very different.

##Figure 8: Proportion of young people by qualification who are NEET for six months or more
 
 
Source: LFS, ONS

Figure 8 shows that there are more young people NEET for six months or more with Level 2 qualifications than those with no qualifications, and also more young people with Level 3 qualifications who are NEET six months than those with no qualifications.

#NEET TWELVE MONTHS OR MORE

We have defined as NEET for fifteen months or more those who are classed as NEET for four out of five quarters, consecutively, observed in the 5-quarter LFS.

We estimate that, in the 8 consistent datasets used (finishing in the 4th quarter of 2015), there were 714 thousand young people NEET fifteen months or more. The confidence interval is between 620 thousand and 808 thousand.

The risk of being NEET for twelve months or more varies strongly with qualification. The risk varies from 2% for those with Level 4 and over qualifications, up to 23% for those with no qualifications. Figure 9 shows this.

##Figure 9: Proportion of young people by qualification who are at RISK OF NEET for twelve months or more
 
Source: LFS, ONS

Figure 9 shows that those with Level 2 or above qualifications have a markedly lower chance of being NEET for twelve months or more than those with qualifications above this level. 

However, because the proportions of young people getting good qualifications has increased, the picture when you look at the balance of young people who are NEET twelve months by qualification looks very different.

##Figure 10: Proportion of young people by qualification who are NEET for twelve months or more
 
 
Source: LFS, ONS

Figure 10 shows that there are many more young people NEET for twelve months or more with Level 2 qualifications than those with no qualifications, and only a little less young people with Level 3 qualifications who are NEET twelve months than those with no qualifications. 

#INDICATOR 6: PERCENTAGE OF EMPLOYED YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE ‘UNDEREMPLOYED’

This indicator measures the number of young people who are over-qualified for their job, want more hours, are in temporary work but want permanent work, or are classed as employed but are on a government programme.  This is important because it indicates where young people and the economy are not reaching their full potential – leading to lower productivity, lower output, and for young people lower incomes and wellbeing.

The overall estimates for young people who are underemployed are in Table 1.

##Table 1: Underemployment by category
	Central	Low	High
Govt scheme	38,000	33,000	44,000
Overqualified	1,517,000	1,485,000	1,549,000
Want hours	569,000	548,000	590,000
Want Perm job	114,000	105,000	124,000
Total Underemployed	2,239,000	2,170,000	2,307,000
Per cent of young people	30.9%	30.0%	31.8%
Source: LFS, ONS

The total estimate is over 2 million, or more than a quarter of all young people. This is based on the average of the four Labour Force Survey datasets up to and including October-December 2015, and therefore represents the 2015 calendar year.

#INDICATOR 7: OCCUPATION AND SECTOR OF EMPLOYED YOUNG PEOPLE WHO USED TO BE NEET

This indicator provides information on the jobs that young people who have been NEET are doing once they start work. It can help to identify where employer engagement activities are best targeted when attempting to reduce the impact of being NEET on young people. 

Figure 11 shows the jobs that NEET young people enter when they start work. The total for the bars in the chart adds up to 100% of the NEET young people who started work. 

These are young people who are NEET at all, so the chart includes those of all durations, including those who are NEET for three months or less. The width of the confidence intervals shows that it would be unwise to try to break this analysis down by the length of time young people were NEET, as the confidence intervals would widen substantially from an already wide set for any smaller group of young people.

Nearly half (45%) of job starts by young people who were NEET are in either elementary work or in sales and customer service work. We cannot reliably distinguish between the proportions going into jobs in caring and leisure jobs, administrative and secretarial, and associate professional and technical jobs.

##Figure 11: Job starts by NEET young people by occupation
 
Source: LFS, ONS

We do not have earnings figures for the NEET young people entering these occupations, but we do have overall earnings figures for young people aged 18-21 in these groups. These are shown in Figure 12.

Figure 12 shows the ranges of hourly earnings for young people aged 18-21 who are employed in these occupation groups. At the time the earnings figures were being collected, the National Minimum Wage for 18-20 year olds was £5.13 (now £5.30) and for those 21 and over was £6.50 (now £6.70).  In addition, there was an Apprenticeship rate of £2.73 an hour (now £3.30) for those 16-18 or older people in the first year of their apprenticeship. 

##Figure 12: Hourly earnings for 18-21 year olds by occupation, April 2015
 
Source: ONS Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings

Figure 12 shows as the central bars the earnings of the middle 50% of young people in that occupation. The central line is the median earnings above and below which 50% of young people in that occupation are found. The ‘whiskers’ to the left and right extend to the earnings level of the lowest 10% (left) and highest 10% (right). All the lowest 10% figures were above the 18-20 Minimum Wage, though in the case of Elementary occupations, this was just 2p an hour over. The lowest 25% (the left hand end of the central bar) was exactly on the adult Minimum Wage for Sales and customer service occupations, caring leisure and other service occupations and for skilled trades. The 25% mark was below the adult National Minimum Wage for those in elementary occupations.

These figures show hourly pay, which enables a comparison with the National Minimum Wage. Weekly pay will depend on whether people are part time, and the hours worked.

Table 2 shows where these occupations fit within a sectoral classification. For example, 33% of NEETS who start work are in the sector that includes wholesale, retail, hotels and restaurants. There are 15% in sales occupations and 12% in elementary occupations. This latter group includes catering assistants, waiters, and bar staff as well as shelf-fillers in retail. The second largest group are caring occupations in public administration, education and health – and social care is the most likely destination in this case. There are a large number of occupation/industry cells in the table with negligible numbers of young people who had been NEET, but a wide spread of small numbers through the remainder of the table. 

##Table 2: Job starts by NEET young people by occupation and sector
	Production Industries	Construction	Wholesaling, Retailing, Hotels & Restaurants	Finance and Business Services	Public, Education Health	Transport communications, other services	Total
Managers, Directors and Senior Officials	0%	0%	0%	0%	0%	0%	1%
Professional Jobs	0%	0%	1%	1%	3%	1%	6%
Associate Professional and Technical Jobs	1%	0%	0%	5%	2%	3%	11%

Total	11%	7%	33%	15%	20%	14%	100%
Source: LFS, ONS

This table is broadly similar to one we have constructed for all young people in work. The major differences are that those who have been NEET are more likely to work in elementary occupations (26% rather than 22% for all young people), less likely to work in skilled trades (8% rather than 10%) and less likely to work in wholesaling, retailing, hotels and restaurants (33% rather than 37%). Within the table, virtually all differences round to 1% or lower. The largest one is that NEET young people are more likely to move into elementary jobs in construction (such as construction labouring), with 3% of jobs rather than the 1% overall. 
 

#INDICATOR 8: SUSTAINMENT OF EXITS FROM BEING NEET 

Figure 13 shows the extent to which young people who were NEET, and stop being NEET, remain in either education or employment.   This matters because it indicates the extent to which young people who enter employment or learning are able to stay there.  There is evidence that some young people can ‘cycle’ between being in and out of NEET, which again can have longer-term consequences for their earnings, employment, health and wellbeing.

We use the Labour Force Survey to measure NEET sustainment.  To do so, we identify those who were NEET at the first out of 5 quarterly interviews, and follow them through the remaining 4 interviews. Those who sustained one year or more were not NEET in any further interview. Those who sustained six months or more were NEET in the first interview and not NEET in either of the two next interviews.

The first bar below shows the proportion of young people who were NEET in the first quarter of measurement but who were no longer NEET in the second quarter (i.e. not NEET after three months).  The second bar then shows the proportion who were still not NEET in the third quarter (i.e. had sustained their exit from NEET for six months).  Subsequent bars then show the proportion still not NEET after nine and twelve months.

The error bars show the confidence interval around the estimates shown. 

Overall, 70% of the young people who sustained one year or more having left NEET moved to employment. By deduction, the remaining 30% moved to education only. This does not preclude those who left to employment being in education as well. In particular, apprenticeships include both employment (usually full-time) and education (usually part-time). The contrary pattern of full-time education combined with part-time employment in shops, bars, etc. is also common among young people.

Most of those who left NEET to other destinations than employment and remained not NEET for a year were classed as economically inactive – but 7% of them were seeking work. Seeking work can be, and frequently is, combined with education, so these were likely to be in education and either seeking a job when they finished their course or a part-time job to help finances while they were studying.

##Figure 13: Exits from NEET and sustainment
 
The error bars show the confidence we have in the estimates. 

	Percentages of NEET young people

Sustained six months or more	24%
Sustained 9 months or more	22%
Sustained one year or more	21%

Figure 14 breaks down by qualification the patterns of one-year sustainment for the group who were NEET.

##Figure 14: Proportion of NEETS who leave NEET in three months and those who sustain not NEET for a year
 
	Initial exits from NEET	Sustained one year or more	Gap
NQF Level 4 and above	74,000	69,000	5,000
NQF Level 3	103,000	74,000	29,000
NQF Level 2	89,000	69,000	21,000
Below NQF Level 2	52,000	32,000	19,000
No Qualifications	37,000	11,000	26,000
Source: LFS, ONS

Both the exit rate from NEET and sustainment in EET for a year or more decline with lower levels of qualification. Importantly, the error bars showing the confidence intervals also widen out as we go down the qualification scale. 

The drop in sustainment to one year is particularly large for those with both Level 3 and No Qualifications. We have excluded from the chart those qualifications with so few young people at either interview point that we could not estimate the percentages.

These figures are based on the Labour Force Survey 5-quarter longitudinal databases, and we have pooled eight of these to provide enough respondents to make these estimates. Therefore, these figures relate to families or individuals first interviewed from July to September 2012 to July to September 2014, and the subsequent five interviews, with the last interviews taking place in October to December 2015. 

#NOTES AND GLOSSARY 
Disadvantaged
Pupils are defined as disadvantaged if they are known to have been eligible for free school meals in the past six years (from year 6 to year 11), if they are recorded as having been looked after for at least one day or if they are recorded as having been adopted from care.
Economically inactive
These are people who are not in work, but who do not satisfy all the criteria for ILO unemployment (wanting a job, seeking in the last four weeks and available to start in the next two), such as those in retirement and those who are not actively seeking work.
NEET
Aged 16 to 24 and not in education or employment
Risk of NEET
The Risk of (being or becoming) NEET is measured as the proportion of young people with that characteristic who are NEET. Therefore, the risk of being NEET for young people with no qualifications is the number of young people with no qualifications who are NEET divided by the number of young people with no qualifications. As this group is relatively small, they can have a high risk of being NEET while they are a relatively small proportion of NEET young people.
Over-qualification
The methods used for defining over qualification are a combination of ONS methods used in their publications on the graduate labour market, and those used by BIS for their similar publication. The ONS publication defines qualifications and occupations as graduate, upper middle (A Level or equivalent), Lower middle (GCSE A-C or equivalent), with the remainder below that. ONS restricts graduate occupations to managerial and professional occupations, while the BIS equivalent includes also associate professional jobs. We have followed BIS in this classification. The appropriate occupations for other classification levels follow the ONS method. Everybody working in elementary occupations who has a qualification at GCSE A-C or above is classified as overqualified. The same applies to those with ‘other qualifications’ which includes overseas qualifications and qualifications such as Large Goods Vehicle licences (and no other UK qualifications). These are only counted as overqualified if working in elementary occupations.

Sustainment
Sustainment is measured by the length of time a young person (who has been NEET) remains in employment or education after leaving NEET.
For Indicator 8 we identify those who were NEET at the first out of 5 quarterly interviews, and follow them through the remaining 4 interviews. Those who sustained one year or more were not NEET in any further interview. Those who sustained six months or more were NEET in the first interview and not NEET in either of the two next interviews.
Underemployment
Underemployment is defined hierarchically - if young people are in a government employment and training programme, they are assigned to that category. Then, if they are not in that category and are working and want longer hours, they are assigned to that category. Then, if they are not already classified as underemployed and are working in a temporary job because they could not get a permanent job, they are assigned to "Want Perm job". The final grouping is those who are overqualified for the job they are doing. Young people are not classified into this group if they have been in any of the previous classifications.
Unemployed
Jobless people who want to work, are available to work and are actively seeking employment.
Youth population – In this analysis, we have used the age range from 16 to 24 in the Labour Force Survey analysis. This has increasingly become the age range used for NEET since 2010.
Qualification Levels
The National Qualifications Framework, known as NQF, sets out the level at which a qualification can be recognised in Northern Ireland, England and Wales.
Qualifications in the NQF are grouped together according to their difficulty. They are given a level from entry level to level 8. The levels are based on the standards of knowledge, skill and competence needed for each qualification. Qualifications at the same level can be very different in terms of content and the length of time they take to complete.

Confidence interval
The LFS survey data is used to make inferences about the whole population. When data obtained from a sample is used in this way, there is an element of sampling error, or uncertainty, about the sample estimate. Sampling errors relate to the fact that the chosen sample is only one of a very large number of samples which may have been chosen, each giving rise to different sample estimates. All LFS based population estimates are subject to sampling error, or uncertainty, since they are based on a sample of individuals rather than the whole population.
Using statistical theory it is possible to say how precise a population estimate is by constructing a confidence interval around it to show the range of values which the true population value lies (i.e. the value that would have been found if the entire population had been surveyed) in the absence of bias. Confidence intervals based on LFS sample estimates are presented as 95% confidence intervals. What this means in practice is that in 19 samples out of 20 we would expect the true value to lie within the 95% confidence intervals constructed.

Professional occupations	A degree or equivalent qualification, with some occupations requiring postgraduate qualifications and/or a formal period of experience-related training.
Associate professional and technical occupations	An associated high-level vocational qualification, often involving a substantial period of full-time training or further study.  Some additional task-related training is usually provided through a formal period of induction.
Administrative and secretarial occupations	A good standard of general education.  Certain occupations will require further additional vocational training to a well-defined standard (e.g. office skills).
Skilled trades occupations	A substantial period of training, often provided by means of a work based training programme.
Caring, leisure and other service occupations	A good standard of general education. Certain occupations will require further additional vocational training, often provided by means of a work-based training programme.
Sales and customer service occupations	A general education and a programme of work-based training related to Sales procedures. Some occupations require additional specific technical knowledge but are included in this major group because the primary task involves selling.
Process, plant and machine operatives	The knowledge and experience necessary to operate vehicles and other mobile and stationary machinery, to operate and monitor industrial plant and equipment, to assemble products from component parts according to strict rules and procedures and subject assembled parts to routine tests. Most occupations in this major group will specify a minimum standard of competence for associated tasks and will have a related period of formal training.
Elementary occupations	Occupations classified at this level will usually require a minimum general level of education (that is, that which is acquired by the end of the period of compulsory education). Some occupations at this level will also have short periods of work-related training in areas such as health and safety, food hygiene, and customer service requirements.

National Minimum Wage
At the time the earnings figures were being collected for Figure 12, the National Minimum Wage for 18-20 year olds was £5.13 (now £5.30) and for those 21 and over was £6.50 (now £6.70).  In addition, there was an Apprenticeship rate of £2.73 an hour (now £3.30) for those 16-18 or older people in the first year of their apprenticeship.
Data sources
Indicator1
Department for Education Key stage 4 attainment data.
Indicator 2 and 3
Several data sources are matched together at an individual level, using personal identifiers such as name, date of birth, gender and home postcode where available: 
•	Pupil level Schools Census database containing information on the participation and personal characteristics of pupils in state schools, collected by DfE. 
•	Awarding Organisation data including that collected as part of the School and Colleges Performance Tables exercise, and separately from awarding organisations as part of the Vocational Qualifications Database up until 2010/11. 
•	Individualised Learner Record (ILR) database covering participation and qualifications obtained in Further Education (FE) and Work-based Learning (WBL), collected by the FE Data Service from learning providers.
Indicator 4 and 8
Labour Force Survey (LFS) from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a unique source of information using international definitions of employment and unemployment and economic inactivity, together with a wide range of related topics such as occupation, training, hours of work and personal characteristics of household members aged 16 years and over. It is used to inform social, economic and employment policy.
The LFS was first conducted biennially from 1973-1983. Between 1984 and 1991 the survey was carried out annually and consisted of a quarterly survey conducted throughout the year and a 'boost' survey in the spring quarter (data were then collected seasonally). From 1992 quarterly data were made available, with a quarterly sample size approximately equivalent to that of the previous annual data. The survey then became known as the Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS). From December 1994
Indicator 7 (Figure 12)
The Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) is the most comprehensive source of earnings information in the UK. It provides information about the levels, distribution and make-up of earnings and hours paid for employees by sex and full-time/part-time working. ASHE is the official source of estimates for the number of jobs paid below the National Minimum Wage.
ASHE is based on a 1% sample of employee jobs taken from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) Pay As You Earn (PAYE) records. Information on earnings and hours is obtained from employers and treated confidentially. ASHE does not cover the self-employed nor does it cover employees not paid during the reference period.
LFS Time periods
The Labour Force Survey is a sample survey which is collected on a panel basis. Each survey participant is interviewed on five quarterly intervals, over a period of 15 months. Therefore, the survey can be, and is, cut in a number of different ways. 
The analysis of underemployment (Indicator 6) is derived from the ‘quarterly’ dataset that uses all the interviews collected in a given quarter.
Indicator 7 – the jobs that NEET young people move into – comes from the 2-quarter dataset. This dataset includes all those who have two consecutive interviews. It therefore includes 4/5 of the sample in the quarterly dataset.
The remaining indicators use the 5-quarter dataset. The number of respondents in this dataset is 1/5 of the numbers in the quarterly dataset (at maximum – some do not complete the interview schedule).
Each of these datasets is weighted by the Office for National Statistics up to the size of the population. This means that, while each respondent in the quarterly survey may be grossed up by a factor of 500 or so, when one uses the 5-quarter dataset the average weighting is more like 4,000 per respondent. Additionally, NEET young people are among the least likely people to respond to the survey. Therefore, weights for NEET young people can be up to or exceed double the average. 
We have pooled datasets to increase the robustness of the estimates given. The error bars indicate the precision of the estimates, and take into account the number of respondents accounting for each result and the weightings used by ONS to gross up those estimates to the population. There are still risks of successive estimates in this index showing large changes due solely to variations within the achieved sample for the Labour Force Survey rather than to underlying change. There are trade-offs between the number of datasets used and the policy relevance of the data published. Using more datasets enables greater precision and smaller error bars, but means that the estimates are less current. The longest grouping we use is when we use the 5-quarter datasets, because there are such small numbers of NEET young people included in these datasets. We have based our analysis in this case on eight successive datasets, which each cover 15 months. Therefore, while the latest interview in the 8 datasets took place in October-December 2015, the first interview would be in July-September 2012. 
Indicators 4-7: based on the average of four Labour Force Survey datasets up to and including October-December 2015, and therefore represents the 2015 calendar year.
Indicator 8: Used Labour Force Survey 5-quarter longitudinal databases, and we have pooled eight of these to provide enough respondents to make these estimates. Therefore, these figures relate to families or individuals first interviewed from July to September 2012 to July to September 2014, and the subsequent five interviews
Methodology
Each LFS dataset was transformed into a common form, so that changes made by ONS were adjusted to a common standard. For example, the qualification variables were changed by ONS to reflect a major change to the qualifications landscape in Scotland. 
The resulting common-form datasets were then added together to produce a single dataset which we then analysed.
Error bars
Presenting confidence intervals is good practice (rarely observed in the think-tank world). However, your funders in PE and HF sectors should be aware of risk metrics in their normal activity. These are risk metrics showing the interval we are 95% confident the true figure is within.
Media outlets may be less willing to deal with risk metrics, so presentation of these could be placed in footnotes or annexes if desired. However, for managing your charities with metrics, it may be sensible to re-run the analyses with more datasets to narrow the error bars. However, then we run into the issue of the economy being distinctly different (and the chances of NEET young people exiting lower). These are trade-offs.
